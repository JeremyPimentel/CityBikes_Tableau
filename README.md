## Summmary
This visualizaiton seeks to describe the usage and client base of CityBikes NYC. Based on the visualizations created, most CityBikes trips are between 0 - 20 minutes, with majority of clients being male. From the heatmap created, the days of the week that have the most trips are monday, tuesday and thursday with stop times being 8am and 6pm which describes clients taking the bikes to and from work. 

Two additional visualizations I would use to assist this analysis would be a city map showing stations that see the most and least number of trips and a line graph showing peak months of the year.
